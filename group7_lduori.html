    <h1 class="heading">Matrix Operations</h1>
    <p class="text">This application performs various matrix operations such as generating a matrix, performing elimination, creating a diagonal matrix, calculating upper matrices, and decomposing matrices into LDU format. Follow the steps to complete each matrix operation.</p>

    <label for="order" class="heading"><h2>Enter the order of the matrix:</h2></label>
    <input type="number" id="order" min="1" placeholder="Matrix order (e.g., 3)">
    <p class="text">Specify the order of the matrix (n x n), for instance, enter "3" for a 3x3 matrix. This input will determine the dimensions of all matrices created in the operations below.</p>

    <div class="matrix-container">

        <!-- Matrix A -->
        <button onclick="show_matrix('matrixA')">Create A Matrix</button>
        <div id="matrixA" class="matrix-display">
            <h2>Matrix A</h2>
            <p>In this section, you will create the initial matrix A based on the specified order. This matrix will serve as the foundation for subsequent operations, including elimination and decomposition. Click the button to display an input form for entering matrix A values.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Elimination Matrix and Upper Matrix U -->
        <button onclick="cal_eli('steps')">Calculate Elimination Matrix and U</button>
        <div id="steps" class="matrix-display">
            <h2>Elimination Steps & U</h2>
            <p>This step performs Gaussian elimination on matrix A to reduce it to an upper triangular form, resulting in the matrix U. The elimination steps are displayed here, showing each transformation applied to matrix A. Matrix U will be essential for later calculations, including finding the L and D matrices.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Diagonal Matrix D -->
        <button onclick="diagonal('diagonalMatrix')">Create Diagonal Matrix D</button>
        <div id="diagonalMatrix" class="matrix-display">
            <h2>Diagonal Matrix D</h2>
            <p>Here, we create a diagonal matrix D from matrix U. This matrix consists of the diagonal elements of U and is used as part of the LDU decomposition. Each diagonal entry reflects the scaling factors applied during the elimination process.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Upper Matrix U' -->
        <button onclick="X('upperMatrix')">Calculate U'</button>
        <div id="upperMatrix" class="matrix-display">
            <h2>Upper Matrix U'</h2>
            <p>In this section, we calculate an adjusted upper matrix U' by factoring out the diagonal matrix D. U' is used in the LDU decomposition and is an upper triangular matrix with 1s on the diagonal. This normalization helps simplify further decomposition.</p>
